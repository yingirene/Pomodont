<h2>Inspiration</h2>
I was really into finding different ways to manage time and become more productive,
and one method that really interested me was <a href="https://cirillocompany.de/pages/pomodoro-technique">the Pomodoro technique.</a>

<h2>Why make this app</h2>
At the time, I felt like I had learned enough about how to program to apply my knowledge into a full-blown project. I put together features of some of my favorite timers and features that I couldn't find in any existing solutions and took the chance to develop my own Pomodoro timer.

<h2>What it does</h2>
A timer that tracks elapsed time as well as time spent working on a task.
<ul>
    <li>Take breaks of alternating lengths.</li>
    <li>See how productive you are by comparing elapsed vs. working time.</li>
    <li>Graphics change depending on what stage of the Pomodoro technique you're at. 
        <ul><li>(e.g. On Break, Working, Distracted, Idle)</li></ul></li></ul>
                                
<h2>How I built it</h2>
I was pretty new to coding, so everything was kind of just thrown together without much structure planned beforehand.

<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>
<ul><li>I found myself needing to make more and more classes as I made progress and the code was getting very messy.</li></ul>

<h2>Whatâ€™s next for Pomodon't</h2>
Fully implementing the settings dialog.
Increase visibility of task area.
Add sounds for alerts (e.g. break alerts, procrastination alerts).

<h2>Built with</h2>
